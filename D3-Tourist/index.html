                            <p>The city of Paris began in the 3rd century BC when a Celtic tribe called the Parisii built a fortified settlement on the Ile de la Cite.
                                The Romans conquered the Parisii in 52 AD and they built a town on the River Seine. The Romans called Paris Lutetia. However Roman Paris was not a particularly large or important town. It had a population of not more than 10,000.
                                In the late 3rd century Paris and the surrounding region were converted to Christianity. However by then the Roman Empire was in decline. In 486 a race called the Franks captured Paris.                                    
                                Under the Franks Paris flourished. In 845 the Vikings raided Paris. The French king paid them 7,000 pounds of silver to leave. But from the 11th century onward Paris prospered again. In the Middle Ages Paris grew rapidly and it became one of the largest towns in Europe. Its population probably reached 200,000 (that might seem small to us but it was huge by Medieval standards). King Philippe-Auguste (1180-1223) built a wall around Paris. He also built the Louvre fortress.                                    
                                Medieval Paris was also a busy inland port with goods being brought to and from its wharves along the Seine. Paris was also noted for its scholars. Paris University became famous. Meanwhile from the late 12th century onward the most famous cathedral in Paris, the Cathedral de Notre Dame was built.                                    
                                However in 1338 the Hundred Years War between France and England began and in 1348 Paris was devastated by the Black Death. In 1357 the mayor of Paris Etienne Marcel led a rebellion in Paris to try and gain more rights for Parisian merchants. However Royalist forces captured Paris in 1358 and Marcel and his followers were executed. In 1420 the English captured Paris. However the French recaptured the town in 1436.
